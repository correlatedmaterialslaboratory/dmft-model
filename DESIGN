Purpose / Scope

A lightweight codebase for performing DMFT calculations on model systems.
Included should be a CTQMC solver and a user-friendly interface for generating
the local hamiltonian.


User Experience

The software will primarily be targeted for use on the command line, executed
via a single call:

 > dmft.py [CONFIG_FILE]

For an end-user, the main interface will be a single configuration file which
specifies
 - Bandstructure
 - Local hamiltonian
 - Embedding/projection scheme
 - Numerical parameters for the tight binding code and DMFT
In more complex systems, we want to provide the option for the user to provide
the band structure and local hamiltonian via supplementary input files in a
to-be-determined format.

Currently, parallelization is only implemented for Kristjan's CTQMC solver. The
user is responsible for interfacing to queueing systems (if any). Also,
currently we do not provide any mechanism for the user to specify the local
hamiltonian and assume the user has created the necessary CIX file for the
ctqmc solver.


Library Backend

Much of the functionality (representation of green's functions, summation over
k-space, basis analysis such as computation of densities) should exist in a
library which can easily be imported as a python module for inclusion in
user-written code.


Code Ownership / Hosting

A clean, succinct landing page which clearly describes the purpose and
capabilities of the code should be the first impression a potential new user
experiences. The page will be hosted via github and should include example use
cases to engage the user, a simple tutorial, and code documentation. The code
repository will be developed by interested parties and will also be hosted on
github.
